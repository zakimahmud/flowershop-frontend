<li><b><a name="question1"> When should i order my flowers? </a></b><br/>
It is a good idea to begin considering your floral options four to six months before your wedding and after you have chosen your bridesmaids' dresses. The color of the bridesmaid dresses usually sets your theme. If your wedding date falls on or near a major holiday such as Valentine's Day or Mother's Day, then you should order sooner because sometimes florists find it necessary to limit the number of weddings they handle on these very busy holidays.
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li><b><a name="question2"> Are all flowers available year round? </a></b><br />
 While many flowers are available throughout the year, there are those that bloom during specific seasons. For example, sunflowers, heather, tulips and lily of the valley are seasonal. Other flowers, such as roses and carnations, are readily available yearlong. Our Wedding Consultants know which flowers are available to you. They are happy to show you your choices of wedding flowers and make recommendations for your special day.
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li><b><a name="question3">When will the flowers be delivered?</a></b><br />Glorious flower Shop's trained personnel deliver wedding flowers when and where you need them. Our timely, courteous delivery staff can deliver to your home, church and reception. Do you want all the wedding bouquets, corsages and boutonnieres delivered to the church along with the ceremonial decorations? In that case the wedding flowers arrive one hour prior to the ceremony. Do you need the wedding bouquets, corsages and boutonnieres delivered to your home for photographs? We can do that, too, when you need them. Wedding reception flowers are delivered to the hall or club as agreed upon. Whatever you need... we deliver. Check our Delivery Info page to see if your city is listed or contact us at 01685200115

<br />
<li><b><a name="question4">What are your guarantees for flower availability, freshness and substitutions?</a></b><br />During the ordering process, our Wedding Consultants inform you of the wedding flower choices that will be available to you at the time of your wedding. When your arrangements are prepared, our design professionals use only the freshest, best quality flowers to create your arrangements. If a substitution becomes necessary, we notify the bride. We have many varieties of flowers at all times from which to choose a substitute. You will always get a flower that is comparable to your original selection and complementary to your wedding flower arrangement.
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li><b><a name="question5">How do the flowers stay fresh? Will they last all day?</a></b><br />Based on the types of arrangements chosen, we will advise you how to care for your particular selections as well as give you general flower care information. For example, a hand tied bouquet should rest in a water source, like a glass or a vase, when you are not carrying it. When you receive your flowers, it is best to handle them as little as possible before the ceremony. Flowers are delicate and naturally sensitive to bruises and temperature changes. Do not expose your wedding flowers to extreme temperatures. At 32 degrees or less, flowers freeze and become discolored and damaged when they are returned to a warmer temperature. Wearing coats over corsages or boutonnieres will crush them. It is best to transport the flowers in the container in which they are delivered. A little care will ensure that your wedding flowers stay beautiful all day.

<li><b><a name="question8">Do my flowers come in a vase?</a></b><br />None of our bouquets come in a vase unless otherwise stated.If you would like to send a vase with your chosen flowers, we suggest the most suitable one for your chosen bouquet as part of your buying process.
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li><b><a name="question9">What if I want to send my order anonymously? </a></b><br />We would not dream of revealing your identity should you not wish us to.  By law, we also adhere to the data protection act that stops any of your personal information from being disclosed.
However, if the recipient believes the flowers are from a person meaning them serious harm please ask them to contact the police and we will reveal the identity to them.
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li><b><a name="question10">What do I do if the flowers don’t look like the picture??</a></b><br />To ensure as long a vase life as possible, some of our flowers will arrive in bud.  This means that not only can they be enjoyed for longer but also that one has the pleasure of watching them bloom.
There may be times that the recipient will receive flowers and one bloom has been replaced by a different flower.  Naturally, we work in tune with the seasons, which change as each week passes and the climate shifts. This may mean, from time to time, we have to create your bouquet using slightly different flowers from those pictured. We will of course make sure we work similar colours and scents into your design and keep it the same shape and style.
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li><b><a name="question11">I love your designs but can not find one that exactly suits my needs. Can you create the perfect gift for me?</a></b><br />Our online products represent a seasonal range.  We can create almost anything in fresh flowers so if you would like us to create something specially for you, you can call our florists on 01685200115
</li>
<br />
<br />
<li><b><a name="question12">How are the flowers packaged?</a></b><br />All of our bouquets and plants are garnished with organza and silk ribbon, seasoned with colourful tissue and served up in a Moyses bag or branded delivery box. Hand tied and gift wrapped flowers are delivered either in a water bubble (‘aqua-pack’) or in a water absorbent bag to keep the flowers fresh. Surrounding your fresh flowers with layers of protective tissue ensures your delivery will arrive in the same condition that it left us in. Our orchid plants wear tissue bonnets to protect their delicate heads during transportation.
Our flowers and plants are always delivered with a handwritten card containing your personal message, a care card and flower food.
